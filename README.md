# SleepNet-Advanced

This repository contains the source codes which try to reproduce the results reported in [SleepNet] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.08262.pdf). However, a different dataset ([SHHS](https://sleepdata.org/datasets/shhs)) will be used because the dataset used in [SleepNet] is not publicaly available.
