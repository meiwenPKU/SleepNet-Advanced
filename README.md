# SleepNet-Advanced

This repository contains the source codes which try to reproduce the results reported in [SleepNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.08262.pdf). However, a different dataset ([SHHS](https://sleepdata.org/datasets/shhs)) will be used because the dataset used in [SleepNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.08262.pdf) is not publicaly available
Please follow the following steps to reproduce the results

# Step 1: download the orgininal data
1.1) download the annotation xml files for shhs1 from https://sleepdata.org/datasets/shhs/files/polysomnography/annotations-events-nsrr/shhs1
1.2) download the edf files for shhs1 from https://sleepdata.org/datasets/shhs/files/polysomnography/edfs/shhs1
