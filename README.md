# SleepNet-Advanced

This repository contains the source codes which try to reproduce the results reported in [SleepNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.08262.pdf). However, a different dataset ([SHHS](https://sleepdata.org/datasets/shhs)) will be used because the dataset used in [SleepNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.08262.pdf) is not publicaly available. 

The objective of SleepNet is to automatically annotate the sleep stage for EEG signals.
